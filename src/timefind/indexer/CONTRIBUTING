Dependencies and Building
=========================

Dependencies should be pinned, so you should no longer have to pull
dependencies.

If you find that a dependency version should be updated, please check with the
Retro-Future mailing list to ensure compatibility.

1. Set your GOPATH (see `go help gopath').
   A reasonable default for retro-future is:

    export GOPATH=/path/to/retro-future-code/

2. Build packages.

   Currently you'll have you cd into each package you'd like to build and run
   `go build`. 

   For example, to build `indexer`:

    cd retro-future-code/src/indexer
    go build
    ./indexer -h

    Usage: indexer [-huv] [-c PATH]
     -c, --config=PATH  Path to configuration file (can be used multiple times)
     -h, --help         Show this help message and exit
     -u, --unixtime     write Unix time to indexes instead of RFC 3339
     -v, --verbose      Verbose progress indicators and messages

3. Build configuration file. (e.g., SOURCENAME.conf.json)

4. Run indexer.

   After building your configuration file, you can run the indexer:

    ./indexer -c SOURCENAME.conf.json
