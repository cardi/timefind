    * v1.0.3 -> v1.0.4

    * Fixed a bug where indexer would segfault if a processor doesn't exist. It
      should now complain appropriately.

    * indexer should continue processing (rather than error out) if while
      reading an input file results in an error.

    * New script to split index files into a recursive structure. (Wes)

    * Better documentation and build fixes. (Wes)

    * Dependencies now managed by dep.

    * Update import paths for various dependencies.

    * Update CONTRIBUTORS.

2016-09-23  Calvin Ardi  <calvin@isi.edu>

    * v1.0.2.5 -> v1.0.3

    * New file processors: FSDB, syslog, and BGP/MRT, CSV.
      (Calvin, Paige)

    * Source code tree has been reorganized and cleaned up. (Paul)

    * timefind and indexer now support traversing the file hierarchy
      with recursive processing with no additional configuration
      needed. (Paul, Paige, Calvin)

    * Index entries now have a 4th column with a "last modified at"
      timestamp: indexer will re-index an existing entry if a file
      was modified after index creation.

    * Index timestamps are written in Unix timestamp format by default.

    * v1.0.2.1 -> v1.0.2.2
      Thanks to Tobias Flach <flach@usc.edu> for reporting the following bugs.

    * indexer (aef/e18): returns error when paths start with shell
      metacharacter '~'

    * indexer (aef/2fe): resulting index is updated if files are renamed
      or removed

    * timefind (aef/4a0): returns errors when invalid timestamps are
      input

    * timefind (aef/785): usage now describes expected TIMESTAMP format
